# CS372-Computer_Networks
Portfolio project for CS372 at Oregon State University


This coding project involved writing a simple client-server chat program using Python sockets. The server only has to handle one client and there is only one socket connection made that is used for the life of the program. There was an extra credit option to turn the chat into a multiplayer ascii game. For more in-depth instructions, check Project_4_instructions.pdf.


Result: 80/75
